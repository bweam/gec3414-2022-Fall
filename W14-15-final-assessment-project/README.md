# FINAL ASSESSMENT

## Critical Reading and Research Communication Task

This assessment is the final part of your ongoing assessment in this course.

The purpose is to help you develop critical reading, writing, and oral communication skills in the context of data analysis, empirical strategy and related issues.

There will be concepts and methods that you may not have been explicitly taught in this course: Part of this assessment gets you to research outside of your comfort zone and to try to understand what you're reading/researching and to communicate that understanding.


## What to do

1. You must select a paper specified in the listing of ``papers``.

2. You may form a research team of no more than FOUR persons. 

    * Note that the larger the group, the more, in terms of substance and form, will be expected of your final report.

    * If you have a team of more than ONE member, then each member must submit a copy of the same project on the assignment portal on ``icampus``.

3. Include a declaration page on your written report detailing:

    * Name of every author on the report in both Alphabetical Spelling and Korean 

    * Student ID number of every author

    * Percentage and description of contribution of each author in the team



## Format

* Typed-up report in PDF form ONLY.

* Replicable Jupyter Notebooks if needed/relevant.

* Use of professionally written and typeset documents in LaTeX is highly recommended.


## Restrictions on written report length

* Maximum 1 page: 
   * Quick summary of (i) Issue/Question raised in the paper; (ii) Key Features of the Model; and (iii) Results of the paper.

* Maximum 4 pages: 
   * Describe and explain key aspects of the paper. You must also demonstrate an understanding of these elements (e.g. by explaining the ideas of the empirical problem, the strategy for eliciting the evidence in question, how quantitative/numerical results were obtained).

* Maximum 2 pages: 
   * Summarize and explain economic results in more detail.

* Maximum 1 page: 
   * Your comments about the paper: modeling/empirical-strategy assumptions, correctness, suggestions for alternatives or extensions.

* No page limit: 
   * References cited in your report.


## Grading rubric

* 70% max: 

    * Critical analysis and precise explanation of the substance of a chosen paper.

    * Mindless, mechanical, and verbatim reproduction of mathematics, sentences, and equations that are already in the paper is discouraged and runs the risk of academic misconduct or plagiarism.

    * Your task is to elucidate and expound on the main setup, the empirical methods, and how they produce key insights. Where possible use plain English in your exposition. If mathematics is required, be sure to define notation and context, and you must still explain what the expressions mean.

    * You are to also provide a critical assessment of the author's method(s) and their insights in general.

    * Useful tips for demonstrating *critical reading and comprehension*: Imagine trying to do a "tear down" of the whole paper. What are the key questions? What makes them interesting for the authors? Does the theory/empirical method serve a greater purpose? Can you replicate or at least map out the steps, essential "tricks" or methods that "make the paper tick"? What happens to main insights if a key assumption is removed? Now explain how these things work to your *Oppa* who has a bachelor's degree from *l'Ã‰cole Polytechnique* in 1956. (You'll have to be more profound and incisive in your writing than just summarizing punchlines.)

* 30% max:

    * Organization and clear writing.

    * Care and attention to detail.

    * Thought for the reader in your presentation structure and style.
